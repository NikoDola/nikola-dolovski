    "bio": "My name is Niko, and I live in North Macedonia. I’m a multidisciplinary visual designer and web developer with a deep passion for creativity, technology, and meaningful problem-solving. My work lives at the intersection of art and function — I shape ideas into experiences that are not only visually compelling but also intuitive, efficient, and smartly built. Over the years, I’ve built strong expertise in UI/UX design, focusing on clean, elegant digital products. I use React, Next.js, TypeScript, and love building smart systems with precision. I’ve launched brands like Horny Rhino and SultryNikki, each crafted with character and purpose. I also explore AI, data, and server tech for fun — constantly learning and improving. I care deeply about doing things right, with clarity and purpose. Design is how I think and build.",
