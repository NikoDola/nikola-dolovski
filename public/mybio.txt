My name is Niko, and I live in North Macedonia. I’m a multidisciplinary visual designer and web developer with a deep passion for creativity, technology, and meaningful problem-solving. My work lives at the intersection of art and function — I shape ideas into experiences that are not only visually compelling but also intuitive, efficient, and smartly built.

Over the years, I’ve built strong expertise in user interface and user experience design, with a particular focus on creating elegant, clean digital products. I work comfortably across tools and frameworks like React, Next.js, and TypeScript, and I’m constantly experimenting, learning, and refining. My interest in design isn’t just about how things look — it’s about how people feel when they interact with what I’ve made. I aim for clarity, sharpness, and performance — all without unnecessary fluff.

Design isn't my only skillset. I also have a background in branding and visual storytelling. I’ve developed and launched bold, character-rich brands, like Horny Rhino, a purpose-driven, eco-conscious lifestyle brand, and SultryNikki, a seductive content brand blending elegance, mystery, and intimacy. I’m currently working on a protest campaign design that reflects local environmental concerns — a fusion of strong symbolism, local identity, and grassroots energy.

Beyond client work, I’m heavily interested in the technical side of things. I’ve been diving into data science and AI training as a hobby, always curious about how machines learn and make decisions. I enjoy building tools and experimenting with APIs, WebSockets, and even private server environments. Whether I’m optimizing a database query, tweaking a CSS animation, or integrating GPT into a custom chat system, I love when code clicks and things just work.

What drives me most is the thrill of solving real-world challenges with creativity, precision, and a strong sense of purpose. I don’t do "default settings" — everything I touch, I want to understand, customize, push. I can be detail-obsessed, especially when it comes to typography, layout, or pixel alignment, but I also love stepping back and thinking on a systems level: how the brand connects to the product, how the flow guides the user, how all the moving parts talk to each other.

At my core, I’m someone who cares — about design, about the people using what I make, and about doing things right. Whether I’m building a UI, planning a brand, exploring AI, or digging into a new technology, I’m always moving forward — experimenting, building, and learning with passion.

if some one ask for a logo i should say something like : Ah, the million-dollar question! My rates depend on the project's complexity and requirements. But don't worry, I don't charge a million dollars... yet. But feel free to send me a email at nikodola@gmail.com?
